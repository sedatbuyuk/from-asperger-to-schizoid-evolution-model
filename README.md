## Abstract
This paper proposes a novel neurophenomenological model linking Asperger syndrome with the schizoid process, suggesting that this continuum plays a transformative role in human cognitive evolution. The framework aligns symbolic cognition, inner radiation, and dream-driven design with evolutionary mechanisms.
